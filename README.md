Kartik ATM Smart Contract
This repository contains the Solidity code for a simple ATM smart contract and a React frontend to interact with it. The smart contract allows the owner to deposit and withdraw Ether, while the React frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the contract.

Smart Contract
The smart contract is written in Solidity and includes basic functionality for an ATM, such as depositing and withdrawing funds. The contract ensures only the owner can perform these actions and uses events to log transactions.

Important functions:

  function getBalance() public view returns(uint256){
        return balance;
    }

    function deposit(uint256 _amount) public payable {
        uint _previousBalance = balance;
        
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner of this account");
        
        balance += _amount;
        
        assert(balance == _previousBalance + _amount);
        
        emit Deposit(_amount);
    }
    
    error InsufficientBalance(uint256 balance, uint256 withdrawAmount);

    function withdraw(uint256 _withdrawAmount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner of this account");
        uint _previousBalance = balance;
        if (balance < _withdrawAmount) {
            revert InsufficientBalance({
                balance: balance,
                withdrawAmount: _withdrawAmount
            });
        }
        
        balance -= _withdrawAmount;
        
        assert(balance == (_previousBalance - _withdrawAmount));
        
        emit Withdraw(_withdrawAmount);
    }
}

Frontend
The frontend is built using React and the ethers.js library. It connects to the Ethereum blockchain using MetaMask and allows the user to deposit and withdraw funds from the smart contract.

Important Functions:

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

    if (window.ethereum) {

      handleAccount(account);
    }

  const handleAccount = (account) => {
    if (account) {
      console.log("Account connected: ", account);
      setAccount(account);
    } else {
      console.log("No account found");
    }
  };

  const connectAccount = async () => {
    if (!ethWallet) {
      alert("MetaMask wallet is required to connect");
      return;
    }

    const accounts = await ethWallet.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
    handleAccount(accounts);

    getATMContract();
  };

  const getATMContract = () => {
    const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(ethWallet);
    const signer = provider.getSigner();
    const atmContract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, atmABI, signer);

    setATM(atmContract);
  };

  const getBalance = async () => {
    if (atm) {
      setBalance((await atm.getBalance()).toNumber());
    }
  };

  const deposit = async () => {
    if (atm) {
      let tx = await atm.deposit(1);
      await tx.wait();
      getBalance();
    }
  };

  const withdraw = async () => {
    if (atm) {
      let tx = await atm.withdraw(1);
      await tx.wait();
      getBalance();
    }
  };

  const initUser = () => {
    if (!ethWallet) {
      return <p>Please install Metamask in order to use this ATM.</p>;
    }

    if (!account) {
      return (
        <button onClick={connectAccount}>
          Click here to connect with MetaMask Wallet
        </button>
      );
    }

    if (balance == undefined) {
      getBalance();
    }

    return (
      <div>
        <p>Your Account: {account}</p>
        <p>Your Balance: {balance}</p>
        <button onClick={deposit}>Transfer 1 ETH</button>
        <button onClick={withdraw}>Withdraw 1 ETH</button>
      </div>
    );
  };


# Starter Next/Hardhat Project

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
